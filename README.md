# LADX_AP_Poptracker
 Poptracker pack for LADX randomizer on Archipelago

Poptracker can be found [here](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/tree/master)

The main focus is [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) support which is based on [LADXR](https://github.com/daid/LADXR)

Do not use it as inspiration to create a tracker, this is a complete mess and I changed how I was handling things 3 times already. I will clean everything eventually but my priority is covering everything first
